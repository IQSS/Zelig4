4.0-5 (August 25th, 2011): Stable release for R.13.1. Removed dependency on 
  the 'iterators' package. This is part of a general move towards shrinking the
  size of Zelig's dependency list. To facilitate this change, the 'mi' object
  has been made more robust, and  the 'zframe' helper object has been removed.

  For specifics, please refer to the CHANGES file

4.0-2 (May 16, 2011): Stable release for R 2.12,1. Major version update, and
  and addition of numerous API features. Core package now contains a mere 7
  models. Dependencies having correspondingly been reduced to:
    MASS
    iterators
    survival
    methods

  For the missing models, please see the software packages:
    bivariate.zelig: bivaraite generalized linear regressions
    mixed.zelig: multilevel (mixed) generalized linear regressions
    multinomial.zelig: multinomial logit and probit regressions
    ordinal.zelig: ordinal logit and probit regressions
    survey.zelig: survey-weighted generalized linear models

  These models can be found on the Harvard IQSS website at:
    http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/
  
  Or via installations with:
    source('http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~mowen/install.R')
