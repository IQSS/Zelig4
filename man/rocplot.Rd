  rocplot(

}
\arguments{
  \item{y1}{response variable for the first model}

  \item{y2}{response variable for the second model}

  \item{fitted1}{fitted values for the first model. These
  values may represent either the in-sample or
  out-of-sample fitted values}

  \item{fitted2}{fitted values for the second model}

  \item{cutoff}{A vector of cut-off values between 0 and 1,
  at which to evaluate the proportion of 0s and 1s
  correctly predicted by the first and second model.  By
  default, this is 100 increments between 0 and 1
  inclusive}

  \item{lty1}{the line type of the first model (defaults to
  'line')}

  \item{lty2}{the line type of the second model (defaults
  to 'dashed')}

  \item{lwd1}{the line width of the first model (defaults
  to 1)}

  \item{lwd2}{the line width of the second model (defaults
  to 1)}

  \item{col1}{the color of the first model (defaults to
  'black')}

  \item{col2}{the color of the second model (defaults to
  'black')}

  \item{main}{a title for the plot (defaults to "ROC
  Curve")}

  \item{xlab}{a label for the X-axis}

  \item{ylab}{a lavel for the Y-axis}

  \item{plot}{whether to generate a plot to the selected
  device}

  \item{\dots}{additional parameters to be passed to the
  plot}
}
\value{
  if plot is TRUE, rocplot simply generates a plot.
  Otherwise, a list with the following is produced:
  \item{roc1}{a matrix containing a vector of x-coordinates
  and y-coordinates corresponding to the number of ones and
  zeros correctly predicted for the first model.}
  \item{roc2}{a matrix containing a vector of x-coordinates
  and y-coordinates corresponding to the number of ones and
  zeros correctly predicted for the second model.}
  \item{area1}{the area under the first ROC curve,
  calculated using Reimann sums.} \item{area2}{the area
  under the second ROC curve, calculated using Reimann
  sums.}
}
\description{
  The 'rocplot' command generates a receiver operator
  characteristic plot to compare the in-sample (default) or
  out-of-sample fit for two logit or probit regressions.
