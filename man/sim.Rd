\title{Generic Method for Computing and Organizing Simulated Quantities of Interest
Simulate quantities of interest from the estimated model
output from \code{zelig()} given specified values of explanatory
variables established in \code{setx()}.  For classical \emph{maximum
likelihood} models, \code{sim()} uses asymptotic normal
approximation to the log-likelihood.  For \emph{Bayesian models},
Zelig simulates quantities of interest from the posterior density,
whenever possible.  For \emph{robust Bayesian models}, simulations
are drawn from the identified class of Bayesian posteriors.
Alternatively, you may generate quantities of interest using
bootstrapped parameters.}

  computations of quantities of interest}

  The output stored in \code{s.out} varies by model.  Use
  the \code{names} command to view the output stored in
  \code{s.out}.  Common elements include: \item{x}{the
  \code{\link{setx}} values for the explanatory variables,
  used to calculate the quantities of interest (expected
  values, predicted values, etc.). } \item{x1}{the optional
  \code{\link{setx}} object used to simulate first
  differences, and other model-specific quantities of
  interest, such as risk-ratios.} \item{call}{the options
  selected for \code{\link{sim}}, used to replicate
  quantities of interest. } \item{zelig.call}{the original
  command and options for \code{\link{zelig}}, used to
  replicate analyses. } \item{num}{the number of
  simulations requested. } \item{par}{the parameters
  (coefficients, and additional model-specific parameters).
  You may wish to use the same set of simulated parameters
  to calculate quantities of interest rather than
  simulating another set.} \item{qi\$ev}{simulations of the
  expected values given the model and \code{x}. }
  \item{qi\$pr}{simulations of the predicted values given
  by the fitted values. } \item{qi\$fd}{simulations of the
  first differences (or risk difference for binary models)
  for the given \code{x} and \code{x1}.  The difference is
  calculated by subtracting the expected values given
  \code{x} from the expected values given \code{x1}.  (If
  do not specify \code{x1}, you will not get first
  differences or risk ratios.) } \item{qi\$rr}{simulations
  of the risk ratios for binary and multinomial models.
  See specific models for details.}
  \item{qi\$ate.ev}{simulations of the average expected
  treatment effect for the treatment group, using
  conditional prediction. Let \eqn{t_i} be a binary
  explanatory variable defining the treatment (\eqn{t_i=1})
  and control (\eqn{t_i=0}) groups.  Then the average
  expected treatment effect for the treatment group is
  \deqn{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n [ \, Y_i(t_i=1) -
  E[Y_i(t_i=0)] \mid t_i=1 \,],} where \eqn{Y_i(t_i=1)} is
  the value of the dependent variable for observation
  \eqn{i} in the treatment group.  Variation in the
  simulations are due to uncertainty in simulating
  \eqn{E[Y_i(t_i=0)]}, the counterfactual expected value of
  \eqn{Y_i} for observations in the treatment group, under
  the assumption that everything stays the same except that
  the treatment indicator is switched to \eqn{t_i=0}. }
